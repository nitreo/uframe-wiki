While services can serve for almost any purpose, they can be used to seperate various features of uFrame, and your application. Examples might include, FacebookService, NetworkingService, AchievementsService...etc

As a matter of fact, at the time of this writing, uFrame ships with two default services, The 'ViewService', and the 'SceneManagementService'.

There is really only one general rule of thumb when implementing services, they should only be listening to events, processing them, and publishing its own events that might be useful to other services. While you can inject other services and use them directly, it's highly reommended to use events as the means of communication.

## Accesing ViewModels in services.

To access a running list of a specific viewmodel just add this property to any service, and make sure you specify the viewmodel type you need.

```
[Inject] IViewModelManager<PlayerViewModel> AllPlayers { get;set; }
```

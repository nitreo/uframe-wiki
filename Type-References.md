_Type Reference_ is a node type that allows you to specify a new type that you can use in other nodes. Behind the scenes, uFrame will create a new empty class with the same name as the type specified in the node.

Inside this class, you can add your own implementation.

Other application of _Type References_ is to use them as handlers in services.
